# Patientist User Guide
Patientist is a desktop app used for managing patients and staff within a medical facility. This application is optimised
for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to fall back
on. If you are a strong typist and are familiar with the system, Patientist can get your tasks done faster and more
reliably than traditional GUI based apps.

## Features


## Notes about formatting
* Words in UPPER_CASE are user supplied parameters, e.g. `addpat n/NAME`: `NAME` is a parameter, and the command can be used as add `n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional parameters, e.g. `addpat n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `addpat n/John Doe t/urgent` or simply as `addpat n/John Doe`
* Items with … after them can be specified 0 or more times, e.g. `[t/TAG]...` means it is valid to not include a tag, or you can chain 1 or more `t/TAG` expressions
* Extraneous parameters for commands that take in exactly 0 parameters will be ignored

## Adding a patient: addpat
Adds a new patient to the system, and places them in the `WARD_NAME` assigned.
